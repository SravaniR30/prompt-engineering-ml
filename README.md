 A curated collection of prompts to evaluate LLMs on advanced machine learning tasks.
# üß† Prompt Engineering Playground for ML Scenarios

Welcome to the **Prompt Engineering Playground**, a curated collection of domain-specific prompts designed to assess and refine Large Language Models' (LLMs) understanding of advanced Machine Learning (ML) concepts. This project is focused on evaluating how well LLMs perform in solving theoretical, applied, and research-level ML tasks through prompt design and response analysis.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Test LLM understanding of complex ML topics.
- Evaluate model accuracy, reasoning depth, and hallucination rate.
- Develop structured prompt templates for use in AI research and model evaluation.
- Contribute to the understanding of LLM capabilities in high-skill, technical domains.

---

## üß™ Prompt Categories

### üîπ 1. **Mathematical Derivation Prompts**
Evaluate whether LLMs can accurately walk through derivations for core ML techniques.

**Examples:**
- Derive the gradient for the softmax cross-entropy loss.
- Explain the update rule in the EM algorithm with math.
- Step-by-step derivation of backpropagation for a two-layer neural network.

---

### üîπ 2. **Real-World ML Scenario Prompts**
Test model understanding in applied ML situations.

**Examples:**
- What tradeoffs are involved in deploying a real-time model on edge devices?
- How would you handle label drift in a production fraud detection system?
- What metrics would you prioritize in a high-precision vs high-recall use case?

---

### üîπ 3. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning Prompts**
Encourage LLMs to ‚Äúthink aloud‚Äù through complex reasoning.

**Examples:**
- You're tuning a model with high variance. Walk through your decision-making process step by step.
- You observe an unexpected drop in validation accuracy. List potential causes and how to troubleshoot.

## üìä Evaluation Criteria

Each LLM response is evaluated on:

| Metric            | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Accuracy**       | Does the response contain correct technical information? |
| **Completeness**   | Is the answer thorough and logically structured? |
| **Depth**          | Does the model explain *why* something works, not just *what* it is? |
| **Hallucination**  | Are there any unsupported or fabricated claims? |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenAI / Anthropic / HuggingFace APIs
- Jupyter Notebooks
- (Optional) Streamlit or Gradio interface for interactive testing

## ‚úÖ How to Use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `notebooks/run_prompts.ipynb` to test prompt outputs from various LLMs.
3. Use the evaluation templates to grade model responses manually.
4. Modify or expand the prompts to explore more ML domains.

## ü§ù Contribution Goals

This project was created as part of a preparation for the **Handshake MOVE Program**, designed to showcase:
- Prompt engineering skills  
- Subject-matter expertise in ML  
- Ability to evaluate and improve LLM performance
