# Real-World Machine Learning Scenario Prompts

These prompts simulate practical, real-world challenges that arise when applying machine learning in production environments. They are designed to test an LLM's ability to reason about deployment, monitoring, scalability, fairness, and model lifecycle.

---

### Prompt 1
> You're deploying a computer vision model to detect defects in manufacturing. What considerations must be made when moving from a lab-trained model to a factory-floor system?

---

### Prompt 2
> You notice model performance degrading in a fraud detection system over time. What could be causing this, and how would you address it?

---

### Prompt 3
> Describe the trade-offs between using a large transformer model versus a distilled model for on-device real-time inference.

---

### Prompt 4
> Youâ€™ve trained a recommendation engine that performs well offline but receives complaints from users in production. What steps would you take to evaluate and improve its real-world behavior?

---

### Prompt 5
> Explain how you would handle class imbalance when developing a machine learning model for disease detection from medical data.

---

### Prompt 6
> How would you design an ML system to detect bias in predictions made across demographic groups in a credit scoring system?
